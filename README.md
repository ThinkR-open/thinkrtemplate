thinkrtemplate
==============

The goal of {thinkrtemplate} is to have a custom template for {pkgdown} pages.

Installation
------------

You can install the released version of thinkrtemplate from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
```

Example
-------

You need to add this code at the top of your vignettes to initialize code folding.
Choose between `"show" === "hide"` or `"show" === "show"` for default behaviour.

``` js
<script type="text/javascript">
$(document).ready(function () {
  window.initializeCodeFolding("show" === "hide");
});
</script>
```
